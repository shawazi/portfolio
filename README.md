### A simple portfolio page using React, initialized with Vite using JS + SWC

# to-do: 
- docker containerization
- test load times
- don't go overboard with imports 
- clean code
- don't be weird

# basic app structure:
- react-router-dom (hashrouter while using gh-pages, browserrouter once live on google domain)
- simple visual notification system, maybe just for "message submitted"
- consider authentication

# layout:
- basic routing
- HOME | PORTFOLIO | ABOUT | CONTACT
- does home = landing?
